## Introduction
This is the second project in the JavaScript track at The Odin Project. It uses Module and Factory Programming. the main goal is to have as little global code as possible.

## Skill
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Factory Design Pattern
- Modules

## Tools
- VSCode
- Live Server
- Git / GitHub

## Resources
- [Min Max Functions for Creating AI Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves)


## To do 
- [X] Set up your project with a HTML, CSS and Javascript files and get the Git repo all set up.
- [X] Store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object
- [X] Create an object to control the flow of the game
- [X] Set up your HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage (for now you can just manually fill in the array with "X"s and "O"s)
- [X] Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. Don’t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
- [X] Think carefully about where each bit of logic should reside. Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects.. but take care to put them in “logical” places. Spending a little time brainstorming here can make your life much easier later!
- [X] Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
- [X] Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!
- [ ] Optional - If you’re feeling ambitious create an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
- [X] Publish to GitHub

## Log
7/14/2021 Setup initial files and read me

7/15/2021 Setup initial HTML to build board and began JS using module pattern for gameboard and factory pattern for players

8/8/2021 through 8/9/2021 Had to take a break at the end of July because I was getting married and data structures and algorithms was coming to an end with so much work and studying due! Yesterday and today, I pushed on this and got a working program live. It could still use a lot of love on the design and an AI to play back. I'll revisit this project later. 

## Bugs
Player names can be blank
